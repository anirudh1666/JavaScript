#MAZE FRONTEND#
----

##Goal##
-----

The goal of this project is to help me learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and make a practice webpage with a maze.

##V1.0##
----

This version is just a precursor for the maze game that I will make by combining a Java backend that will generate the mazes with a frontend in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

For this version I have used a previously generated maze from my practice Java Maze generator program. The graph had to be manually built but in the actual implementation the backend will communicate the graph to JavaScript.

This code isn't very efficient or good. It will be refactored and optimized in the actual implementation so it doesn't require as much memory and will run faster.

Lastly, this program doesn't allow user to move. It only displays the maze to the user.
