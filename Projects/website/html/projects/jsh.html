            <h3 style="text-align:center">12/2020</h3>
            <p>This application was developed for my Software Engineering module in Year 2 in a group of 3.</p>
            <p>JShell is a replica of Unix Bash that is written in Java. This application is fully dockerised, 
               and various software development methodologies were used to help streamline development. </p>
            <p>We chose to use the Agile Development methodology over the Waterfall method because our team was 
               small; consequently, we were flexible with how we would work and could often go back to make revisions. 
               On the other hand, if we had been a bigger team, the rigid structure of the waterfall method 
               would be ideal since it would be more organised.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Furthermore, we applied Test-Driven Development, TDD, to make our code more modular and reduce 
               time spent debugging. By the end, our tests achieved 90%+ branch coverage. Regression and black-box 
               testing were also incorporated into our methodology. Regression testing helped catch new bugs while black-box 
               testing lets a tester test from the point of view of a user which makes it unbiased.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In our code, we used the factory, visitor, decorator, and dynamic dispatch design patterns. 
               The main reason we decided to use the visitor design pattern is that each application is like a 
               node on a tree where the root is the interface Visitable, and the visitor object can visit the specific 
               node (each application such as ls, cut, pwd implements Visitable and acts as a node) that it wants to. 
               The main problem I felt with this is that it made our design a lot more complicated and harder to understand, 
               however, it also decoupled the implementation of the applications with the creation. Polymorphism was 
               leveraged since visitor.visit would work with multiple different types of objects. We used dynamic 
               dispatch to create the application object without knowing which specific application object it is, and the 
               factory would handle the creation of the object by using a switch case statement. The unsafe decorator was used in 
               testing because it would cause JShell to exit when an error occurs rather than catch the exception
                and carry-on running. This meant we could quickly test new functionality.</p>
