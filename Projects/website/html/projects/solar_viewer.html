            <h3>01/2020</h3>
            <p>During my first year, I wanted to learn more about Java and I also had an interest in space. Thus, I attempted to 
               create an animation of the solar system using Java. My objectives included learning about Java Swing, Object-Oriented 
               Programming (OOP), and creating an accurate representation of our solar system.

                <p class="caption">Image 1: Basic solar system animation using Java Swing.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The first thing I did was research Java Swing and the orbital speeds, radii, and sizes of the planets in our solar system. 
               Luckily, Java Swing was not extremely complicated, and I was able to grasp it quickly. On the other hand, I faced an issue with 
               making the planets accurately sized. Unfortunately, the sun would be so big that the other planets would be near invisible, and if I 
               tried to make the planets a bit larger, the sun would swallow up the first 3. The only solution would be to allow users to zoom in or out 
               of the animation to view planets; however, at this point of my programming career, I did not think of this and left the planet sizes inaccurate. 
               I thought if the screen was bigger, I would be able to do it but otherwise there is no solution.
