            <h3>03/2021</h3>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/anirudh1666/Consultation-">Link to repository</a></h3>
            <p>As part of my Systems Engineering module in Year 2, 
               I was assigned to a group of 3 and tasked to build an application for the 
               Royal College of General Practitioners, RCGP, and the National 
               Health Service, NHS. </p>
            <p>We chose to build a highly customisable search engine targeted 
               at old Window’s machines because GPs generally have low specification 
               computers; however, they have blazingly fast internet speeds. 
               To allow our application to run seamlessly on old computers, we used 
               the C# and the .NET framework since they are both built to work with 
               Windows and made sure that our application had low RAM usage; in fact, our 
               application only requires up to 60 MB to run. </p>

            </div>
            <p>Additionally, we realised that we could analyse the search query data generated 
               to provide insights in an interactive web dashboard. By clicking on an interactive 
               map of the UK, GPs can filter the data to view insights that is geographically 
               relevant to them. Consultation+ is fully GDPR compliant, and users can opt-out of 
               sharing data with us if they want to. </p>

            </div>
            <p>By leveraging Microsoft Graphs, we were able to incorporate single sign-on, SSO, and 
               store user data to their OneDrive. As a consequence of using Graphs for login, we 
               did not have to worry about storing passwords and other sensitive information securely. 
               Furthermore, Consultation+ stores users search history and settings to their OneDrive. 
               We made sure to restrict Consultation+ settings so that it cannot read or write to 
               other folders in the user’s OneDrive.</p>
            <p>Another API that was used is Google’s Custom Search API. The main advantage of this 
               API is that it lets users perform searching using a customisable search engine. More 
               tech-savvy users can create their search engine and link Consultation+ to it using 
               developer mode. As a result, our application can be tailored to meet the specific 
               needs of various specialists, e.g., a dermatologist can create a custom search engine 
               that searches dermatology websites.</p>

                <p class="caption">Image 4: Screenshot of interactive web dashboard </p>
            </div>
            <p>To further refine search results, we added a recommendation feature. Users can upvote or 
                downvote articles that they found helpful or unhelpful. Highly upvoted articles are 
                displayed more prominently to users. This feature is optional, so users can disable 
                it if needed.</p>
            <p>Consultation+ uses HTTP and AJAX requests to communicate with the backend and dashboard. 
               Our backend is built in Python; specifically, our databases that store users’ emails and 
               search data use the Django framework. </p>
            <p>While trying to generate insights, our group came across a problem. A lot of GPs use different 
               terms for the same disease when searching, e.g., one GP might search ckd while another might 
               type chronic kidney disease. To address this issue, we integrated a clustering 
               algorithm in the backend to help group similar search terms together. Every week, our 
               model is further trained using the search data from that week.</p>
            <p>Finally, we have provided unit and integration tests for the desktop application and the Django backend. </p>
