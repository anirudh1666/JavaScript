            <h2><u>JavaScript Maze Game</u></h2>
            <h3>08/2020</h3>
            <p>Due to Coronavirus, my first year at university was cut short. The extra 
               time allowed me to do some new projects, one of which was a maze game that ran in your browser.</p>
            <p>The main objective of this project was to act as an introduction to JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. 
               I used the books <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Way-Learn-JavaScript-technology/dp/1497408180/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=a+smarter+way+to+learn+javascript&qid=1592392447&s=instant-video&sr=8-1">
                A Smarter Way to learn JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Way-Learn-HTML-CSS/dp/150867387X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=a+smarter+way+to+learn+html&qid=1592392494&sr=8-1">
                Smarter Way to learn HTML and CSS</a>, both by Mark Myers, to teach myself about web development.</p>
            <p>Once I knew the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I divided the project into three subproblems which were:
                <ol>
                    <li>Generating a random maze</li>
                    <li>Rendering and displaying maze to the user.</li>
                    <li>Controlling player movement.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>I wanted to create try out and compare multiple maze generation algorithms. The ones I chose to implement are 
                Kruskal's, Prim's, and recursive backtracker. The easiest one to implement is recursive backtracker while Kruskal's and 
                Prim's are equally as difficult. I have written out the steps for each algorithm below. 
            </p>
            <p><h4><b>Recursive Backtracker</b></h4>
                In this algorithm, I used a stack rather than recursion because the stack will allow deep recursion without causing 
                the stack overflow error. The main advantage of this algorithm is that is it is easy to implement, on the other hand, its 
                main disadvantage is that it generates mazes with a low branching factor. In other words, the mazes it creates are prone to have 
                long corridors.
                <ol>
                    <li>Push starting cell onto the stack and mark it as visited.</li>
                    <li>Pop off the stack. Randomly pick an unvisited neighbour of the popped cell. 
                        Push the neighbour cell and popped the cell onto the stack, and mark neighbour as visited.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 2 until you reach a cell that has all its neighbours visited.</li>
                    <li>Pop off the stack and check if the cell has any unvisited neighbours. Do this 
                        until you reach a cell that has unvisited neighbours. Go to step 2.</li>
                    <li>Continue this algorithm until the stack is empty.</li>
                </ol>

            </div>
            <p>Solving problem 2 consisted of tinkering with a website I built with a maze that my algorithm already generated. 
               I decided to use the JavaScript library PixiJS to handle player movement and rendering the maze because it would provide a good 
               opportunity to learn a new JavaScript library; additionally, PixiJS allows us to create player animations which default JavaScript does not.
               The maze was rendered by drawing rectangles from each pair of cells that had an edge to each other. I used the window height as the limiting 
               factor for line width because the window height is generally smaller than the width.</p>
            <p>Once the maze had been rendered, all I had to do now was to create a player sprite, provide animations for its movement, and make sure that it cannot 
               make any illegal moves. The sprite and its animations were downloaded from an online website. PixiJS enables us to load in the spritesheet and draw segments 
               representing a frame of movement. For each direction of movement, I created an array that contained the frames for that direction. PixiJS would then loop those frames 
               into an animation when the player was moving. 
            </p>
            <p>Finally, my last task was to prevent the player from moving off the maze. Initially, I tried to calculate the dimensions of the maze the player is in and check if its 
                position is in bounds; however, this method proved to be too time consuming and buggy. Alternatively, I decided to check if the player sprite would move onto 2 black pixels facing 
                the direction the player wants to go. If either pixel is black, then we have hit a wall and, therefore, the player cannot move there. 
            </p>
            <p>In the future, I will extend this game by implementing the A* path finding algorithm to display the path through the maze to the player.</p>
