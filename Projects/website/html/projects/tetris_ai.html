            <h2><u>Tetris Bot</u></h2>
            <h3>11/2019</h3>
            <p>In my first year, I partook in a competition to build a bot that plays Tetris. The bot that obtains the 
               highest score wins the competition. This was my first exposure to the world of machine learning. Initially, I 
               had no clue on how I would go about building this bot but after some contemplation I came up with a solution.
            </p>
            <div class="img_div">

            </div>
            <p>My solution works by evaluation every possible move that my bot can make and then scoring each of them. The 
               highest scoring move is stored and executed. The next problem was how was I going to score each move? What kind of 
               factors influenced the Tetris score?
            </p>
            <p>Once my research was completed, I decided on a few heuristics to use. I chose to use aggregate height, holes, differences in 
               height between successive columns and "PUT MORE HERE!!". Now how would I weight each of these factors?
            </p>
            <p>At the start, I simply plugged in random values for the scoring equation hoping that I would eventually obtain the optimal ones; however,
                I quickly realised that this would not work since there are an infinite number of possible values. I needed to use maths or computer science to find 
                these weights. This is where the genetic algorithm factors in.
            </p>
            <p>The genetic algorithm works by initialising 100 different Tetris bots, each randomly assigned weights. We score each bot and the top 5 are kept
               while the rest are discarded. Now, we initialise 100 new bots but they are all variants of the top 5. We repeat this until we obtain weights that give us 
               a high enough score. The genetic algorithm is appropriately named taking its inspiration from natural selection. By leveraring the genetic 
               algorithm, I was able to find the optimal weights for my heuristics.
            </p>
            <p>Currently, my Tetris bot only evaluates the next move to find the best scoring one. However, this can be improved upon by adding multiple lookahead moves. This would 
                give my bot a significant performance boost and would be able to run for much longer.
