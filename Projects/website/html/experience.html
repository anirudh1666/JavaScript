                <h3><u>Penultimate Computer Science student @ UCL</u></h3>
                <h4>10/2019-05/2023</h4>
                <p>Achieved a first in my second year. Unfortunately due to covid, my first year exams were cancelled, so there were only 
                    two grades, pass or fail. My degree is tailored to be more mathematical and theoretical by having a Maths IEP, Integrated 
                    Engineering Programme, minor and selecting Quantum Computation and AI and Neural Computing for my elective modules this year. In my final 
                    year, I will be focusing more heavily on machine learning.

                <h3><u>Automation Engineer @ UCL</u></h3>
                <h4>08/2021-Current</h4>
                <p>Worked within the UCL CS department to configure a highly customised
                    instance of Microsoft Dynamics. Worked with a significant proportion of the Microsoft stack to 
                    integrate Power BI, SharePoint, Outlook, and Dataverse with Dynamics. 
                    Additionally, I was tasked to perform data cleaning and analysis of existing
                    databases within the CS department. Finally, Power Automate was leveraged to 
                    automate mundane, repetitive tasks such as bulk uploading contracts. 
                </p>
                <p><b>Skills Gained: </b>Intricate understanding of the Microsoft Stack, Intermediate data cleaning 
                     skills in Excel, Intermediate level of skill working with Power BI and Power Automate.</p>

                <h4>01/2020-12/2020, 10/2021-Current</h4>
                <p>Each week, I would hold after school clubs where I would teach kids aged 6-12 about various science 
                    topics using experiments and active discussions. During the hour that I would teach, I was completely
                    responsible for all of the kids and ensuring their safety as well as their learning. 
                </p>
                <p><b>Skills Gained: </b>Gained an in-depth understanding of the best techniques to teach and understand subject 
                    matter; for example, active learning, the process of critically analysing what you are taught, is a much more 
                    effective method of teaching than passive learning, the process of memorisation and note-taking. Improved my communication
                    and presentation skills.</p>

                <h3><u>Mentorship Executive @ UCL Computer Science Society</u></h3>
                <h4>10/2021-Current</h4>
                <p>As a mentorship executive, I was responsible for all tasks related to mentoring and teaching. I devised new methods to 
                    help improve student attendance at teaching lessons. For example, I suggested that we can incorporate teaching streams where
                    each stream would focus on a particular subject, such as machine learning or software engineering. Students can pick which one 
                    they find more interesting and attend the relevant workshops. Furthermore, we could work with other societies such as Artificial 
                    Intelligence or Technology Society to hold joint training workshops. Another problem that our society faced was that a lot of 
                    teaching workshops in other societies are rudimentary, so more advanced students would find them dull. To combat this, I suggested
                    that we hold advanced teaching sessions rather than basic ones as the people who were joining the Computer Science society were part of 
                    the CS department or experienced programmers.

                <h3><u>Programming Tutor @ UCL</u></h3>
                <h4>10/2021-Current</h4>
                <p>I am a programming mentor for a group of six first year CS students at UCL. Employed the skills gained from working as a Science 
                    Teacher to effectively teach programming. This is demonstrated by the fact that I would never give the students direct answers, but 
                    rather I would ask helpful questions to get them thinking along the right lines. Furthermore, I placed heavy emphasis on debugging techniques instead 
                    of optimal programming techniques because I think that debugging is much more time consuming and frustrating than coding. Finally, I applied 
                    the 80/20 principle, also known as Paretto's Principle, to demonstrate that thorough planning using a pen and paper before coding significantly helps to 
                    reduce coding time. The 20% in this case is planning and the 80% is coding.

                <p>Tutored a student in Year 10 about GCSE Maths and Sciencs. Prior to my tutoring, my student achieved an A in Maths and Chemistry, B in Physics, and C in 
                    Biology. By the end of our tutoring sessions, she was achieving A*'s' in Mathematics (scoring up to 93% on tests), Physics, and Chemistry along with an A in Biology.

                <h4>06/2021-07/2021</h4>
                <p>Organised, sorted, filtered, and aggregated data for analysis, and performed basic calculations with functions and formulas in 
                Excel, and SQL queries and temporary tables in databases. Furthermore, I learned about design thinking, created visualisations, and 
                dashboards in Tableau, and worked on my communication skills to present engaging data-driven stories. Lastly, I wrote code in R to 
                clean and analyse data, used RStudio to edit and run my code, and created detailed visualisations. Prior to completing this course, I had been 
                considering a career as a data analyst. After completing this course, I have learnt much more about data analysis and realised that I would prefer to work 
                as a Software Engineer.

                <h3>Stanford Machine Learning Course By Andrew Ng</h3>
                <h4>05/2021-06/2021</h4>
                <p>Undertook a course on Coursera about the Mathematics behind commonly used ML algorithms such as regression, K-Means, Perceptron, and more. Furthermore, I coded these 
                    algorithms using Octave. I found this course extremely enjoyable and interesting; for example, I loved learning about what actually goes on from a mathematical perspective 
                    during machine learning rather than from a programming perspective.

                <p>Assisted in coming up with novel ideas to help out families struggling with Covid-19. Some of the ideas that I suggested include hosting virtual yoga/working out sessions 
                    to promote fitness, supply children without electronic devices with library cards so they do not miss out on online learning, and creating a hotline number for depressed or 
                    lonely people to call to talk to others and seek help.
