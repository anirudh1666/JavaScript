                    <p class="date">2020-Now</p>
                    <p class="work-p">My responsibilites included having a class of kids from ages 9-12
                        anywhere from once to three times a week. I would be responsible for all the kids and
                        would be required to teach them for an hour about a different science topic each week.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-p">Skills gained:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Communication: Teaching young kids complex ideas helped me articulate my speech so that
                                it would be simple to understand.
                            </li>
                            <li>Leadership: I was responsible for over 20 kids in some classes so a lot of focus was
                                required to make sure no kids hurt themselves, made a mess or went missing. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Organisation: Each week would have a different lesson plan so I would need to read over 
                                topics in advance to make sure I understand it and can present the topic clearly. We would
                                also do experiments which also required preplanning and setting up.
                            </li>

                    <h3 class="title">Chemical Engineering taster course</h3>
                    <p class="date">2018</p>
                    <p class="work-p">Undertook a 3 day taster course in Chemical Engineering at UCL. During this time
                        we have multiple projects to help us get a feel for Chemical Engineering and Engineering in general.
                        For example, on the last day we were assigned groups and told to build a car out of legos and various other
                        materials that would be powered by a chemical reaction between baking soda and vinegar.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-p">Skills gained:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teamwork: Throughout the course we were in groups which forced us to work together and communicate
                                effectively. 
                                Communication: Additonally, during the course we had to do a presentation on our car that was powered
                                by a chemical reaction. This assignment improved my communication skills as I was one of the people who had a 
                                larger amount of content to present and had to explain our car design in terms of aerodynamics in a manner that would
                                be easy to understand. 
                            </li>
