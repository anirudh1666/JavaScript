##MAZE GAME##

Used a depth first search (recursive backtracking) algorithm to generate the maze and then allowed the player to move by clicking buttons. The difficulty can be changed by altering the number of cells on the canvas. 

Problems I faced included:

Allowing player to move using keyboard keys: Originally, I wanted to allow the player to move around by pressing the arrow keys on their keyboard. I implemented this by using a loop, however, I failed to realise that the JS loop would just continue to loop infinitely and I needed to add a timer or find a way of making the JS code stop being run until a key is pressed. I found a way around this problem by adding buttons to the maze which meant when a button is pressed only then the JS code for player movement would run.

Learning JavaScript and HTML/CSS: Before this project I had very little experience with HTML/CSS and none with JavaScript. So for this project I had to work through books and teach myself HTML/CSS in more depth and JavaScript from scratch. Luckily, both of these languages are quite simple and easy to pick up so it wasn't too difficult.
