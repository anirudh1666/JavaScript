        <h1>MY PRACTICE WEBSITE</h1>
        <h2><span class="standout">By Anirudh Lakra</span></h2>
        <p>This is my first website I have made.<br>I am using the book "A smarter way to learn
        HTML/CSS".</p>
        <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lorises here.</p>
        <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
        <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter.</p>
        <div id="chapter 10">
            <h3 class="emphasis">This heading is in italics.</h3>
            <p><i>This paragraph uses the italics tag to make it italics</i></p>
            <p><b>This part is in <span class="emphasis">bold by using the bold tag</span> in HTML.</b></p>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 11">
            <p class="chapter11">This paragraph has slightly larger distance between letters,
                words and line-height. It was done in seperate css file.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 12">
            <h3>This heading is in the center.</h3>
            <p class="justified">This paragraph is justified. This means all the lines should end
                at the same place so they line up. Here is random text to help test this so that that it lines
                up. Need some more text to help reach the end of the second line. Is it there yet?
            </p>
